/*
 Number of Arithmetic Triplets
You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff. A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

i < j < k,
nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.
Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.
